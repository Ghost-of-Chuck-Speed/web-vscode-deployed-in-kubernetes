# web-vscode-deployed-in-kubernetes

### Side project to deploy development enviornments into a cluster, expirimenting with different frontend and authentication methods. The only one of these charts that have been tested so far is :
> vscode-in-cluster-nginx
### Gave a good result but wasn't doing any SSL just yet. Worked fine for a proof in minikube.

### The goal would be to have some sort of authentication infront of the cluster like keycloak or oath2 to protect the environments. The main reason behind trying this was to enable secure develpment on any device with self-hosted infrastructure.
